# Generative Watercolors (WIP)
Started out attempting to implement the rough method of imitating real life watercolors with algorithms described by Tyler Hobbs in his essay [How To Hack A Painting](https://tylerxhobbs.com/essays/2020/how-to-hack-a-painting)

future goal is to create an interactive web app where users will be able to paint on the canvas with these watercolors

Current state of algorithm implementation as of February 1st 2021:
