# Generative Watercolors (WIP)
Started out attempting to implement the rough method of imitating real life watercolors with algorithms described by Tyler Hobbs in his essay [How To Hack A Painting](https://tylerxhobbs.com/essays/2020/how-to-hack-a-painting)

Current state of algorithm implementation as of February 1st 2020:
